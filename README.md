# Tic Tac Toe Game

This repository contains a Tic Tac Toe implementation with two different graphical interfaces:

1. **Tkinter UI** (`game.py`) – basic interface using the Tkinter library.
2. **PyQt5 UI** (`pyqt_ui.py`) – a more advanced interface built with PyQt5 that includes a score display and menu options.

## Running the PyQt5 Interface

1. Install the required dependency:
   ```bash
   pip install PyQt5
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python pyqt_ui.py
   ```

Use the **Game** menu to start a two‑player game or play against the AI with different difficulty levels.
